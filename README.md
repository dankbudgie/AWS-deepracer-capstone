# AWS-deepracer-capstone
This repositiory contains the code and other materials used for the AWS Deep Racer and Autonomous Driving capstone project for Arizona State University.

The repository is organized such that there are reward functions with sample results, and models in separate folders. This way, one can choose either to (re)create new models from scratch using our reward functions as a basis, or to use a precreated model archive to import into a physical car model.

It should be noted that there is no way to import a model into the DeepRacer console with one of these archives. Therefore, importing a model into the console will require importing from an s3 bucket, which we will also provide here.
